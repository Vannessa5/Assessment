Provide a concrete implementation of the "ScriptParser" interface.

Example ant build.xml is provided, though you may wish to modify the "Main"
main program


The expected output from the "Main" program is:

Expanded line: /opt/bea/wlserver6.1:/opt/bea/wlserver6.1/lib/weblogic_sp.jar:/opt/bea/wlserver6.1/lib/weblogic.jar:/home/BSS1/uif/jar/log4j.jar:/home/BSS1/uif/jar/tibrvj.jar:/home/BSS1/uif/jar/Maverick4.jar:/home/BSS1/uif/jar/TIBRepoClient4.jar:/home/BSS1/uif/jar/dom4j-full-1.1.jar:/home/BSS1/uif/cc/cfg
